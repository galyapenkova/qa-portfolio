# QA Automation Engineer Portfolio

Welcome! This repository is the hub for my QA portfolio.  
It links to focused demo projects and stores documentation deliverables.

## Projects (Overview)
1. **Manual Testing & Documentation**  
   Test Plan, Test Cases, and Bug Reports for a small public web app (demo).
2. **API Testing with Postman**  
   Postman collection and tests against a public API (e.g., reqres.in).
3. **UI Test Automation (Playwright)**  
   Basic smoke/functional E2E tests (login/CRUD) with clear structure.

> Note: Some projects are separate repositories. I link them here once published.
